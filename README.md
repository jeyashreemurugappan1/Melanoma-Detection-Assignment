# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort 
needed in diagnosis.
